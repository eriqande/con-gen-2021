## Wednedsay, September 8, 2021

The presentation follows the narrative in the following html document:

* [https://eriqande.github.io/con-gen-2021/bayes-mcmc-gtyperr-narrative.nb.html](https://eriqande.github.io/con-gen-2021/bayes-mcmc-gtyperr-narrative.nb.html)

Within that notebook are links to the Shiny Apps I have written to play with genotype likelihoods (as well as directions on how to use them).  If you want to get the associated R project, you can go to
my directory on the ConGen Box at: 

* [https://umt.box.com/s/n3x7v1hpqkf4h9glu41whxrqaostoqva](https://umt.box.com/s/n3x7v1hpqkf4h9glu41whxrqaostoqva)

and then download the `ngs-genotype-models` directory.

Or, you can also just download it or clone it from GitHub:

* [https://github.com/eriqande/ngs-genotype-models](https://github.com/eriqande/ngs-genotype-models)

Once you have that `ngs-genotype-models` directory you can open the RStudio project
`ngs-genotype-models.Rproj` within the directory and then open any one of the Rmd 
documents in the top level directory (named `001-allele-freq-estimation.Rmd`,
`002-genotype-likelihoods-from-reads.Rmd` and
`003-read-inference-gsi.Rmd` in RStudio).  RStudio will prompt you to install any
needed packages
if you don't already have them (namely `tidyverse` and `shiny`).  After that,
clicking the `Run Document` button at the top of the document will create a
Shiny App for your Hands-On excercises.

These don't run on the ConGen Shiny Server, so you have to run these on
your personal computer.

And, _only as a last resort_, if you can't get the Shiny Apps working in RStudio on your computer, you can visit their pages on `shinyapps.io`:

* [https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/001-allele-freq-estimation/](https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/001-allele-freq-estimation/)
* [https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/002-genotype-likelihoods-from-reads/](https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/002-genotype-likelihoods-from-reads/)
* [https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/003-read-inference-gsi/](https://eriqande.shinyapps.io/003-read-inference-gsi/)
